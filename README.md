# 3D-Reconstruction
sparse reconstruction and dense reconstruction. Sparse reconstructions generally contain a number of points, but still manage to describe the objects in question. Dense reconstructions are detailed and fine-grained. In fields like 3D modelling and graphics, extremely accurate dense reconstructions are invaluable when generating 3D models of real world objects and scenes.
